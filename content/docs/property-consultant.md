Buying a property at home is already considered as quite a big step and most likely for many the biggest purchase they ever make furthermore buying a property abroad and in this case Portugal is an even bigger venture. Sound independent advice from a property consultant or layer is a must and information prior to making this step is to my opinion essential to reach a balanced decision. In a personal meeting with me or one of our team members we can in 1 or 2 hours talk you through the process of purchasing or selling and answer your many of the questions you certainly will have.

In case your questions can not be answered we will be able to set up a meeting with one of the solicitors or lawyers we work with.

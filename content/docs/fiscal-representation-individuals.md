Anybody owning a property or bank account in Portugal now by law needs official fiscal representation as they are unable to communicate with the Authorities or are not in the country. For example I represent many off-shore companies and many individuals, who now need to have by law a local representative and fiscal address or representative who can represent and defend the interest with the Portuguese authorities.

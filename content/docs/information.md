Without doubt Portugal and in particular the Algarve has a lot to offer for foreigners. The Brits in fact have discovered the area as the first as an ideal place to holiday or even permanent living.  With its fine climate the whole year round, it lends itself for many outdoor activities and as many people call it "a better quality of life". However do not let the sun blind you as there is more to it. For that reason I have launched many years ago a new free informative web site dealing in depth with many topics which could be of interest to you.

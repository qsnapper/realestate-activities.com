## **ReAct - Realestate Activities**

### Introduction

[www.realestate-activities.com](http://www.realestate-activities.com/) is an informative website owned by Robert M.L. Snapper.

The object of this site is to give you a better insight view of the services we can provide.

Let me introduce myself:

I have been in the real-estate business in Portugal since 1982. I am still the Director of “ROBAN Realestate Actividades Ldª" a realesate company trading under the name "REALESTATE ALGARVE" based in Lagos, and I am also the Managing Director of Pargo ReAct Ldª. an investment company.

My main activity has  been acting as a realestate agent but we also were involved in many other related activities..

However I decided to stop my realestate activities on 31-12-2024 but I will continue assisting and advising old clients on an indivual and personal basis. I have been living and working in Portugal for over 45 years therefore I am convinced that you can take advantage of my “Portugal Experience & Expertise”.

My office is in Lagos in the Urbanisation of Iberlagos, Bloco J - Office 11 - 8600-540 Lagos.

### Information

Without doubt Portugal and in particular the Algarve has a lot to offer to foreigners. The Brits in fact have discovered the area first before the revolution (1974) finding it an ideal place for holiday and particularly permanent living.  With its fine climate the whole year round, it lends itself for many outdoor activities and as many people call it "a better quality of life". However do not let the sun blind you as there is more to it. For that reason I have launched many years ago a free informative web site dealing in depth with many topics which could be of interest to you. For further info see [www.realestate-algarve.info](http://www.realestate-algarve.info/)

### Consultancy

Buying a property in your home country is already considered as quite a big step and most likely for many the biggest purchase they ever make in their live.  However buying a property abroad and in this case Portugal is an even bigger venture and challenge. Sound independent advice and information prior to making this step is to my opinion essential to reach a balanced decision. In a personal meeting we can in 1 or 2 hours talk you through the process of purchasing or selling and answer your many of the questions you certainly will have.

### Conveyance & Documentatoin

Many people possibly have seen a nice little farm house or made contact directly with owners/sellers, taxi drivers, bar tenders or any other person willing to help you.  Or even with an estate agent who does not speak your language. Language barriers are one of the most common causes for misunderstandings. Be careful with what people tell you. Most of the time there is no bad intention involved but few people  know how  the bureaucracy works, know the latest laws or what is or isn’t possible. Things change rapidly nearly every week. Of course a (local) lawyer can help and we will not hesitate to advise you to consult one if we feel that is necessary. Although most of the lawyers speak perfectly English nowadays we also will be able to assist you and accompany you in case as English may not be your mother tongue.

### Valuations

Besides to assist you advising with buying and/or selling many may feel the need to have an independent valuation to be carried out. Are you not sure about the price of an object in mind or might you need if for other purposes we can provide this professional service. Valuations may be needed also for different purposes like court cases, divorce or your National inland revenue.

### Project Management

In the past I was involved with the construction of many villa from small to big. In case you decide to purchase a building plot or an old farm house to convert please make sure you can afford what you intend to do. As good locations are getting scares many decide to buy an older property in the right location to do it up and modernise in order to meet today’s standards. Let somebody make you a good budget as unfortunately things always turn out more expensive than expected and there is nearly always hidden cost. Read the full article on our info site:

### Property Management

Once the owner of a house or Apartment it is more or less inevitable that you will need somebody to look after your property. Quite often friends will offer to do his for you but using a professional team has additional value. They are here 365 days of the year to assist you. For quite a few clients we took take care or the day to day running of their properties by doing either full management or we provide individual tailor made services. This part of the business has been taken over by 2 old employees, Enid Hut and Caroline Noterman. Their company Pamvillas, [www.pamvillas.com](http://www.pamvillas.com)  is based also in the same building adjacent to my office, and they are at office Nº 10. 

### Rentals is now done by Pamvillas.

Besides the management of properties we also have a department dealing with rentals. Portugal is not cheap anymore and to keep a property will cost you a certain amount per month. By letting your property you may be able to have the property free of charge with the possibility to use it whenever it suits you. Popular in UK now of course is “buy to let”. Luckily we now have legislation in place which regulates this all. But please note that you are not allowed to let your property without a proper AL license issued by the local town-council.

### Mortgages

Might you feel the need to have a mortgage on your property in Portugal we also can advise you on this. We have good contacts with bank and many mortgage lenders. 

### Representation

Besides advising you regarding buying and selling properties, some owners also ask me to represent them in the sale or purchase of their property. Besides individual representation I also represent off-shore companies and foreign registered companies in Portugal.

### Fiscal Representation

Although anybody owning a property or bank account in Portugal no longer by law needs an official fiscal representative we advice you still to appoint one as in general you will be unable to communicate with the Authorities due to a language barrier and lack of knowledge of legislation and local laws. For example I represent many off-shore companies and many individuals and the Authorities will in case of me being your representative address their questions directly to me.

### Tax Returns

Anybody living in Portugal or letting their property is obliged to submit in Portugal on a yearly basis a tax return declaring their worldwide and/or rental income. Our office knows how to deal with these matters. Tax returns in your own country might be already difficult, in a foreign country it may turn out even more complex. Also many people in the past have forgotten to declare the sale of their property the year after the sale. Heavy fines and interest can be the result if you forget.

Resuming: anybody who is a Resident in this country is also obliged to submit a tax return declaring their world wide income! This part of the business also has been taken over by Pamvillas.

### Red tape & beurocratic matters

Nowadays many people not only have a holiday place but have decided to take up permanent Residence in Portugal. This obviously has many consequences and you will have to comply with Portuguese legislation. You have to become a Resident, maybe need to be registered with the National Health Service and many more issues. We will be able to assist.

### Translations & Interpreters

In case people need documents or letters to be translated from Portuguese to English or Dutch to Portuguese or reverse we will be able to assist. You may need an interpreter to speak to or negotiate or you may need an interpreter in court. This part also has been taken over by Pamvillas.

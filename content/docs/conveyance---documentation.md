Many people possibly have seen a nice little farm house or made contact directly with owners/sellers, taxi drivers, bar tenders or any other person willing to help you.  Or even with an estate agent who does not speak your language. Language barriers are one of the most common causes for misunderstandings. Be careful with what people tell you. Most of the time there is no bad intention involved but few people  know how  the bureaucracy works, know the latest laws or what is or isn’t possible. Things change rapidly nearly every week. Of course a (local) lawyer can help and we will not hesitate to advise you to consult one if we feel that is necessary. Although most of the lawyers speak perfect English we also will be able to assist you and accompany you in case this would be of additional value.

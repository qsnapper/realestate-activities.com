In December 2001, the Portuguese Parliament enacted new tax measurements directed against Offshore Property Companies.
One of the requirements for “non-resident companies without permanent establishment” is to appoint a fiscal representative in Portugal.
For many of my clients who I have advised in the past I have complied with the obligation to register their company with the local tax department in which your property is located.

As your fiscal representative, my service includes:

* Resourcing accurate and current information in Portugal for Beneficial owners regarding offshore company obligations as well as relevant legislation.
* Most of the above-mentioned info will be made available to you on 2 specially dedicated web-sites [www.realestate-algarve.info](http://www.realestate-algarve.info) and [www.realestate-activities.com](http://www.realestate-activities.com)
* Clarification of pertinent procedures and interpretations with Finançes
* Communications liaison between Finançes and the Offshore Property Company
* Reporting to  Beneficial Owners and to Directors regarding Company status in Portugal
* Acting as agent.

Please note that each owner may have individual requirements, therefore no 2 situations are identical.
